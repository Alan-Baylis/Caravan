High Prio:
	- Add basic player movement and trading

Med Prio:
	- Create a few more interesting biomes using the BiomeManager
	- Go through Chunk.cs and do small optimizations
	- Go through ChunkGenerator.cs and do small optimizations
	- Go through World.cs and do small optimizations

Low Prio:
	- Implement thermal erosion
	- Implement hydraulic eriosion
	- Make it possible to slow down / increase the time speed
	- Make Regenerate work with Chunk Objects


Finished:
	- Refactor te spawning of trees and towns. ChunkGenerator should handle all that stuff.
	- Make trees combine into single mesh
	




Scrapped:
	- Rewrite ChunkGenerator in such way that it doesn't have to be a monobehaviour. Terrain generation should be orchestrated by World with the other classes being used by it
